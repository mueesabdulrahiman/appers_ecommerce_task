- Followed a clean, modern e-commerce UI inspired by common production apps.

- Skeleton loaders are used instead of spinners to improve user experience during data loading.

#### Architecture & State Management

- State Management: Provider

- Chosen for simplicity, readability, and suitability for a small to medium-scale app.

- Architecture:

- Clear separation of concerns:
